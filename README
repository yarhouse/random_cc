# Random CC Generator

A very basic costume-contest (known as a 'cc') catagory randomizer
I created for my supergroup guild in Champions Online
http://spearchampions.freeforums.org/

Some catagories overlap in similarity, like Sexy and Cute, or Scary
and Intimidating. This script ensures that both options in a similar
catagory cannot be returned for the final result, but also makes
the list randomized more so that neither option could be returned 
in the final result as well.
